\beginverse
\[G]Mama, take this \[D]badge off of \[Ami]me \[Ami7]
\[G]I can't \[D]use it any\[C]more
\[G]It's getting \[D]dark, too dark for me to \[Ami]see \[Ami7]
\[G]I feel like I'm \[D]knockin' on heaven's \[C]door
\endverse
\beginchorus
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
\endchorus
\beginverse
Mama wipe the blood from my face
I'm sick and tired of the war
Got a lone black feelin', and it's hard to trace
Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
\endverse

\beginverse
Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
That long black cloud is comin' down
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
\endverse
