\beginsong{Hurt}[by={Johnny Cash}]

\beginverse
I hurt myself today
to see if I still feel.
I focus on the pain
the only thing that's real.
A needle tears a hole
the old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
but I remember everything.
\endverse
\beginchorus
What have I become?
my sweetest friend.
Everyone I know
goes away in the end..
And you could have it all
my empire of dirt.
I will let you down
I will make you hurt.
\endchorus
\beginverse

I wear this crown of thorns
upon my liar's chair
fall of broken thoughts
I cannot repair..
Beneath the stains of time
the feelings dissapear.
You are someone else
I am still right here.
\endverse
\beginchorus

If I could start again
a milion miles away..
I would keep myself
I would find a way..
\endchorus
