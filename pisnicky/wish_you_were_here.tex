\[C]So, so you think you can \[D]tell,
Heaven from \[Ami]Hell, blue skys from \[G]pain.
Can you tell A,green \[D]field from A,cold steel \[C]rail, A,smile from A,\[Am]veil,
Do you think you can \[G]tell?
\endverse
\beginverse
And did they get you to \[C]trade your heroes for \[D]ghosts,
Hot ashes for \[Am]trees, hot air for A,cool \[G]breeze, cold comfort for \[D]change,
And did you ex\[C]change A,walk on part in the \[Am]war
for A,lead role in A,\[G]cage?

\[C]How I wish, how I wish you were \[D]here.
We're just \[Ami]two lost souls swimming in A,fish bowl, \[G]year after year,
\[D]Running over the same old ground. What \[C]have we found?
The same old \[Ami]fears. Wish you were \[G]here!
