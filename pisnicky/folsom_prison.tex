\beginsong{Folsom Prison Blues}[by={Johnny Cash}]
\transpose{-3}
\beginverse
I \[G]hear the train a-comin'; it's rollin' 'round the bend,
An\[G]d I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know \[G7]when,
I'm \[C7]stuck at Folsom Prison and time keeps draggin' \[G]on.
But that \[D7]train keeps a-rollin' on down to San An\[G]tone.
\endverse
\beginverse
When I was just a baby, my momma told me, "Son,
Always be a good boy; don't ever play with guns."
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die.
When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry.
\endverse
\beginverse
I bet there's rich folk eatin'in a fancy dining car.
They're prob'ly drinkin' coffee and smokin' big cigars,
But I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free,
But those people keep a-movin', and that's what tortures me.
\endverse
\beginverse
Well if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine,
I bet I'd move it all a little farther down the line,
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay,
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away.
\endverse
