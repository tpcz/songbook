This \[D]thing called love, I \[G]just can't \[C]handle \[G]it,
This \[D]thing called love, I \[G]must get \[C]round to \[G]it,
I ain't \[D]ready, \[B]Crazy Little \[C]Thing Called \[D]Love.
This \[D]thing (this thing) called love (called love)
It \[G]cries (like a baby) in a \[C]cradle all \[G]night,
It \[D]swings (woo woo), it jives (woo woo),
It \[G]shakes all over like a \[C]jelly \[G]fish,
I kinda \[D]like it, \[B]Crazy Litle \[C]Thing Called \[D]Love.
There goes my \[G]baby,she \[C]knows how to rock 'n' \[G]roll.
She drives me \[B]crazy, She gives me \[E]hot and cold \[A]fever,
Then she \[F]leaves me in a cool cool sweat.

\[A]I gotta be \[D]cool, relax, Get \[G]hip, get \[C]on my \[G]tracks,
Take a \[D]back seat, hitch hike,
And \[G]take a long ride on my \[C]motor\[G]bike
Until I'm \[D]ready, \[B]Crazy Little \[C]Thing Called \[D]Love.
