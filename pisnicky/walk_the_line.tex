\beginverse                              
\[A]I keep a \[E]close watch on this heart of \[A]mine
\[A]I keep my \[E]eyes wide open all the \[A]time.
\[A]I keep the \[D]ends out for the tie that \[A]binds
\[A]Because you're \[E]mine, I walk the \[A]line
\endverse

\beginverse
I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line
\endverse

\beginverse
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line
\endverse

\beginverse
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line
\endverse
