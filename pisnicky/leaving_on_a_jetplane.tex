\beginsong{Leaving On A Jet Plane}[by={John Denver}]
\beginverse


\[D7(A7)]All my \[G(C)]bags are packed \[C(F)]I'm ready to go,
\[G(C)]I am standing \[C(F)]here outside the door,
\[G(C)]I hate to wake you \[C(F)]up to say good-\[D(G)]bye.
But the \[G(C)]dawn is breaking, \[C(F)]it's early morn'
\[G(C)]The Taxi's waiting, \[C(F)]he's blowing his horn,
\[G(C)]Already I'm so \[C(F)]lonesome I could \[D(G)]die.
\endverse
\beginchorus
So \[G(C)]kiss me and \[C(F)]smile for me,
\[G(C)]Tell me that you'll \[C(F)]wait for me,
\[G(C)]Hold me like you \[Ami(Dmi)]never let me \[D(G)]go,
'Cause I'm \[G(C)]leaving \[C(F)]on a jet plane,
\[G(C)]Don't know when \[C(F)]I'll be back a\[D(G)]gain.
\[G(C)]Oh babe \[C(F)]I hate you \[D(G)]go.
\endchorus
\beginverse
There's so many times I've let you down
So many times I've played around,
I tell you now they don't mean a thing.
Every place I'll go I'll think of you
Every song I'll sing I'll sing for you
When I'll come back I'll bring you wedding ring.
\endverse
\beginchorus
So kiss me...
\endchorus
\beginverse
Now the time has come to leave you
One more time let me kiss you
Then close your eyes I'll be on my way.
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times I don't have to say.
\endverse
\beginchorus
So kiss me...
\endchorus
