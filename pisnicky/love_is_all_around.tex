\beginsong{Love Is All Around}[by={}]

\beginverse
I feel it in my fingers
I feel it in my toes
Love is all around me
And so the feeling grows
\endverse
\beginverse
It's written on the wind
It's everywhere I go, oh yes, it is
So if you really love me
Come on and let it show, oh
\endverse
\beginchorus
You know, I love you, I always will
My mind's made up
By the way that I feel
There's no beginning
There'll be no end
'Cause on my love you can depend
\endchorus
\beginverse
I see your face before me
As I lay on my bed
I kinda get to thinking
Of all the things you said, oh yes I did
\endverse
\beginverse
You gave your promise to me
And I gave mine to you
I need someone beside me
In everything and I do, oh yes I do
\endverse
\beginchorus
You know, I love you, I always will
My mind's made up by the
Way that I feel
There's no beginning
There'll be no end
'Cause on my love you can depend
\endchorus
\beginverse
Got to keep it movin'
Ooh, it's written in the wind
Oh, everywhere I go, yeah, ooh well
So if you really love me, love me, love me
Come on and let it show
\endverse
