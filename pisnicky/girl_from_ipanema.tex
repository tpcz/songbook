\beginsong{The Girl From Ipanema}[by={Carlos Jobim}]


\beginverse
\[Fmaj7] Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl
\[G7] from Ipanema goes walking, and when
\[Gm7] she passes, each one \[Gb7] she passes goes
\[Fmaj7] a-a-h...           \[Gb9]
\endverse
\beginverse
\[Fmaj7] When she walks she's like a samba that
\[G7] swings so cool and sways so gentle, that when
\[Gm7] she passes, each one \[Gb7] she passes goes
\[Fmaj7] a-a-h...           \[Fmaj7]
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[Gbmaj7] Oh, but I watch her so
\[Cb9] saddly.
\[F#m7] How can I tell her I
\[D9] love her?
\[Gm7] Yes, I would give my heart
\[Eb9] gladdly.      But each
\[Am7] day when she walks to the \[D7-9] sea, she
\[Gm7] looks straight ahead not at \[C7-9] me.
\endchorus
\beginverse
\[Fmaj7] Tall and tan and young and lovely the girl
\[G7] from Ipanema goes walking, and when
\[Gm7] she passes I smile, \[Gb7] but she doesn't
   \[Fmaj7] see.           \[Gb7] She just doesn't
   \[Fmaj7] see.           \[Gb7] No, she doesn't
   \[Fmaj7] see.   \[Gb7]   \[Fmaj7]
